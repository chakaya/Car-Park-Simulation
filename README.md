# Car-Park-Simulation

## Overview

This Car Park Simulation Project encompasses the development of two programs designed to simulate the operations of a car park, tracking vehicle entries, exits, available spaces, and maintaining parking records. The project is divided into two parts: a text-based console application and a graphical user interface (GUI) application using TKinter. The core objective is to manage parking spaces efficiently and provide users with the ability to query their vehicle's parking record using a ticket number.

## Features

* Read Parking Record File: At the start, the program reads parking records from a CSV file.
* Track Available Parking Spaces: Maintains a count of available spaces and assigns parking space identifiers to vehicles.
* Menu Options: Offers a menu for users to enter or exit the car park, view available spaces, query parking records by ticket number, or quit the program.
* Vehicle Entry: Records vehicle registration, entry time, assigns a parking space and ticket number, and updates available spaces.
* Vehicle Exit: On exit, prompts for registration number, calculates parking fees, records exit time, and updates available spaces.
* Query Parking Record: Allows querying of parking records by ticket number.
* Save Parking Records: Upon quitting, saves all parking records to the initial CSV file.

## Part 1:Text-Based Console Application

Developed without a GUI, focusing on core functionalities and user interactions through the console.

## Part 2: TKinter GUI Application

Enhances user experience with a graphical interface, implementing the same functionalities but with graphical input and output methods.
